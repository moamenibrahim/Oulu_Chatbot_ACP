Textparse-module contains tools for parsing raw text.

sentence_tokenize(raw_text)
    Input:
        Raw text.
    Ouput:
        List of sentences.

check_question(sentence)
    Input:
        Raw text.
    Ouput:
        Boolean
    Details:
        Returns True if '?' in tokens, False otherwise.
    
parse_statement(raw_text, lemmatize = False)
    Input:
        Raw text.
    Ouput:
        List of dictionary objects. Dictionary keys are syntactic relations and values are lists of textual tokens. If optional argument lemmatize = True, tokens are lemmatized.
    Details:
        Using a breadth-first approach, assigns a key for each token of the current phrase, based on their syntactic relations. If a token is a conjunctive verb (defines a conjunctive subsentence), adds that verb to a job queue as a new root. Then, repeat the procedure for the new root. Each conjunctive sentence is returned as a separate dictionary. The values corresponding to keys are lists because they may contain multiple items.
